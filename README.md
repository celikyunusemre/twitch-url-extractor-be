# Twitch URL Extractor Backend

### Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot: The backend is built using the Spring Boot framework, which provides a robust and efficient foundation for Java-based applications.
- Maven 3.9.3: Maven is used as the build and dependency management tool, simplifying the project configuration and management.

### Installation
To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the backend repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/celikyunusemre/twitch-url-extractor-be
cd twitch-url-extractor-be
```
2. Build the project using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. To run the backend server locally, use the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the server on a specified port (usually **8080** by default) and make the API accessible.
